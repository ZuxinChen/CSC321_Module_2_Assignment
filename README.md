# Description
Create a base code in a language of your choice that would read in each line of the below if it were in a text file, 
break down the characters, and return the correct answer. It must type check that only ints can be added to ints, 
doubles can be added to doubles, and do the correct math. The code should actually work. It should be commented and explained fully.
We have only two data types in our language (int and double). Our language has a print statement. It could also just create a variable without assignment as as with. 
Standard conventions apply, such as ; ending the sentence. It should check that x and y were already designated - i.e. you can't use a variable unless it has a type.

int x = 5;

int y = 6;

print(x+y\*y);
